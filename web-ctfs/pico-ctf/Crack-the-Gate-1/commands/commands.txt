Manual reproduction steps (no shell commands required):

1. Launch the PicoCTF challenge instance and open the login page in Firefox.
2. Submit the login form once using:
   Email: ctf-player@picoctf.org
   Password: 123
   (This is just to generate the network request; the password is irrelevant.)
3. Open Firefox Developer Tools -> Network tab.
4. Find the login POST request, right-click it and choose "Edit and Resend" (or use a header-editing extension).
5. In the request headers, add:
   X-Dev-Access: yes
6. Resend the request. Inspect the response body â€” the JSON contains the flag: picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_49d1d186}.
7.Alternatively intercept the same POST in Burp Suite, add header X-Dev-Access: yes, forward request and view response.
